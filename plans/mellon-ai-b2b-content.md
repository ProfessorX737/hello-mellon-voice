## Section 9: FAQ

### Section Title
"Questions? We've Got Answers"

### FAQ Items

**Q: Is this just ChatGPT with a fancy wrapper?**
A: No. We use multiple AI models (including Claude, GPT-4, and specialized models) and customize them specifically for your business. Plus, we handle all the integration, training, and ongoing support — something you don't get with raw AI tools.

**Q: How does the free trial work?**
A: Simple. You get 30 days of full access to your AI team. No credit card required. If you don't love it, cancel anytime with no questions asked. If you stay, your first month starts after the trial.

**Q: Can you really come to my office?**
A: Absolutely. We're based in Sydney and regularly travel to Melbourne and Brisbane for in-person setups. There's no extra charge for the service itself — just cover our travel costs. Remote setup is always free and works great too.

**Q: What if I need something custom?**
A: That's our specialty. Our developers can build custom AI workflows, integrations, and automations specific to your business. It's included in Business and Enterprise plans.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Completely. We're privacy-first by design. We can keep all your data on local Australian servers if you prefer. We never sell your data, never train models on your information, and you can delete everything anytime.

**Q: How quickly can we get started?**
A: Most teams are up and running within 48 hours of their setup call. If you choose in-person setup, we'll schedule within a week (depending on location).

**Q: What if my AI team makes a mistake?**
A: They're constantly learning and improving. Plus, you have direct access to our developers for adjustments. We monitor quality and proactively reach out if we see ways to improve.
