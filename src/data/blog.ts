      <p>If you're searching for the <strong>best dictation app for Mac</strong>, you're not alone. Voice dictation and speech-to-text software have exploded in popularity as people look for faster ways to write. The average person types at 40–70 words per minute (WPM), but the <strong>best dictation apps</strong> can reach 120–150+ WPM with high accuracy. That's a game-changer for emails, docs, and notes.</p>
      
      <h2>What Makes a Great Dictation App?</h2>
      <p>The best dictation software for Mac should offer: <strong>accuracy</strong> (especially for medical and technical terms), <strong>privacy</strong> (does your voice go to the cloud?), <strong>speed</strong>, and <strong>universal app support</strong>—so you can dictate into any text field, not just one app.</p>
      
      <h2>Comparing the Best Dictation Apps for Mac</h2>
      <p><strong>Mellon</strong> is a free, privacy-first dictation app that runs 100% locally on your Mac. No subscriptions, no cloud—your voice never leaves your device. It works in every app, supports custom shortcuts, and reaches 150+ WPM. If you want the best free dictation app with zero privacy trade-offs, Mellon is hard to beat.</p>
      <p><strong>Wispr</strong> and <strong>VoiceInk</strong> are popular paid options with cloud processing. <strong>MacWhisper</strong> uses Whisper AI locally with a one-time purchase. <strong>Apple's built-in dictation</strong> is free but sends audio to Apple's servers and requires internet.</p>
      
      <h2>Best Free Dictation App for Mac</h2>
      <p>For the <strong>best free dictation software</strong> that keeps everything on your Mac, Mellon stands out. No account, no subscription, no data collection. Just download and start dictating. It's the best free speech-to-text app for Mac users who care about privacy and speed.</p>

    excerpt: "Comparing the best free dictation apps for Mac. Which free speech-to-text and voice typing software is right for you? We break it down.",
    content: `
      <p>Finding the <strong>best free dictation apps</strong> for Mac can be tricky. Many "free" options are either limited, send your voice to the cloud, or push you toward paid plans. Here's an honest comparison of the top free speech-to-text and voice typing software for Mac.</p>
      
      <h2>Apple Dictation (Built-in)</h2>
      <p>macOS includes free built-in dictation. It's convenient, but it sends your voice to Apple's servers for processing—so it requires internet and isn't fully private. Accuracy is good for general use but can struggle with technical terms and medical vocabulary.</p>
      
      <h2>Mellon: Free, Local, Private</h2>
      <p><strong>Mellon</strong> is one of the few truly free dictation apps that processes everything on your Mac. No cloud, no account, no subscription. Your voice never leaves your device. It works offline, in every app, and reaches 150+ WPM. For the best free dictation software that respects your privacy, Mellon is the top choice.</p>
      
      <h2>Other Free Options</h2>
      <p>Browser-based tools like Dictation.io are free but only work in the browser. Some apps offer free tiers with limits (e.g., recording length or daily caps). If you want unlimited, private, system-wide dictation for free, Mellon is the standout.</p>
      
      <h2>Why Free Dictation Matters</h2>
      <p>Voice typing shouldn't require a subscription. Whether you're a student, professional, or someone with typing difficulties, access to good speech-to-text software matters. Mellon proves that the best free dictation app can also be the most private.</p>

    description: "How to type faster with QWERTY keyboard tips, or skip typing entirely with voice dictation. Compare typing speed vs speech-to-text at 150 WPM.",
    date: "2025-02-01",
    excerpt: "Want to type faster? We compare keyboard tips, typing speed, and QWERTY techniques with voice dictation—and show why many people are switching to speech-to-text.",
    content: `
      <p>"<strong>How can I type faster?</strong>" is one of the most searched questions online. The average person types 40 WPM. Professional typists hit 70–90 WPM. But here's the thing: even the best typists can't match voice dictation. The best dictation apps reach 120–150+ words per minute with high accuracy. So the real question might be: should you learn to type faster, or switch to voice?</p>
      
      <h2>How to Type Faster: Classic Tips</h2>
      <p>If you stick with a keyboard, these tips help: <strong>touch typing</strong> (use all fingers, don't look at the keys), proper <strong>QWERTY keyboard</strong> posture, and practice. The best keyboards for typing include mechanical options that reduce fatigue. Aim for 70+ WPM as a professional benchmark. But improving typing speed takes months of practice.</p>
      
      <h2>Voice Dictation: Skip the Keyboard</h2>
      <p>Voice dictation lets you speak at 150+ WPM without touching a keyboard. No carpal tunnel, no typing fatigue, no learning curve. Tools like Mellon process speech locally on your Mac—so you get speed, privacy, and accuracy in one. For heavy writers, emails, and docs, voice dictation often beats even the fastest typists.</p>
      
      <h2>Typing Speed vs Dictation Speed</h2>
      <p>At 60 WPM typing, 3,000 words takes 50 minutes. At 150 WPM with dictation, it takes 20 minutes. That's 30 minutes saved per day—over 6 hours per week. The best dictation apps aren't just faster; they're dramatically faster.</p>
      
      <h2>Best of Both Worlds</h2>
      <p>Many people use both: keyboard for quick edits and short messages, voice dictation for long-form writing. The best dictation software works in every app, so you can switch seamlessly. Mellon is free and runs entirely on your Mac—no subscription, no cloud.</p>

    title: "Best Speech-to-Text for Mac: Why Privacy-First Dictation Matters",
    description: "The best speech-to-text app for Mac keeps your voice on your device. Compare cloud vs local dictation and why privacy matters for voice typing.",
    date: "2025-01-28",
    excerpt: "When you use speech-to-text, does your voice go to the cloud? We explain why privacy-first dictation matters and which Mac apps keep your data local.",
    content: `
      <p>When you ask for the <strong>best speech-to-text</strong> or <strong>best dictation app</strong> for Mac, accuracy and speed matter. But so does privacy. Many dictation apps send your voice to remote servers for processing. That means your words—meeting notes, medical dictation, personal messages—are stored and processed by third parties. If that bothers you, you need a privacy-first option.</p>
      
      <h2>Cloud vs Local Speech-to-Text</h2>
      <p>Cloud-based dictation (Wispr, Otter, Google Docs voice typing) sends your audio to servers. It's fast and feature-rich, but your data leaves your device. Local dictation (Mellon, MacWhisper, some VoiceInk modes) processes everything on your Mac. Your voice never leaves your computer. No internet required. No data collection.</p>
      
      <h2>Why Privacy Matters for Voice Typing</h2>
      <p>Voice is biometric data. What you dictate can include sensitive information—client names, health details, confidential ideas. The best speech-to-text app for privacy-conscious users keeps that data on your device. Mellon does exactly that: 100% local processing, no cloud, no account, no tracking.</p>
      
      <h2>Best Dictation App for Privacy</h2>
      <p>Mellon is free and runs entirely on your Mac. It works offline, in every app, with 150+ WPM accuracy. If you want the best dictation software that never sends your voice anywhere, Mellon is the answer. Download once, own it forever—no subscription, no strings.</p>

    description: "For ADHD, typing can be a barrier. Voice dictation removes friction and helps you capture ideas. Best dictation apps for ADHD productivity.",
    date: "2025-01-20",
    excerpt: "ADHD and typing don't always mix. Voice dictation lets you speak your thoughts as they come—no keyboard, no friction. Here's how it helps.",
    content: `
      <p>If you have ADHD, you know the struggle: ideas come fast, but getting them onto the page can feel like climbing a wall. Typing requires sustained focus, fine motor control, and the patience to sit at a keyboard. For many with ADHD, that's a barrier. <strong>Voice dictation</strong> changes the equation. You speak; the words appear. No keyboard required.</p>
      
      <h2>Why Dictation Helps ADHD</h2>
      <p>Voice dictation removes the friction between thinking and writing. Ideas flow directly from your mind to the page. You're not fighting the QWERTY keyboard or losing focus mid-sentence. The best dictation apps for ADHD users work in every app—notes, email, docs—so you can capture thoughts wherever they strike.</p>
      
      <h2>Best Dictation App for ADHD</h2>
      <p>Mellon is built for this. It's free, runs locally on your Mac (no distractions from signup flows or subscriptions), and works in any text field. One shortcut, and you're dictating. It's part of the Chronocat ecosystem—tools designed with ADHD productivity in mind. No account, no cloud, no friction.</p>
      
      <h2>Speed and Simplicity</h2>
      <p>At 150+ WPM, voice dictation is faster than most people can type. For ADHD, that speed matters: capture the idea before it slips away. Mellon keeps it simple—no complex setup, no learning curve. Just speak and write.</p>
